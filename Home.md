# Welcome to the workshop labs for "Dapr for building distributed .NET applications"

In these labs you will learn the basics of Dapr and how to use it to build distributed applications using .NET and C#. 

The lab uses an existing .NET based application for a ticket selling webapplication. The "GloboTicket" website is not using Dapr yet, but during the labs you will add Dapr support and start deploying the application to a Kubernetes cluster on your local development machine and also to Azure. At the end of the workshop and the labs you can have the GloboTicket application running as a cloud-native application leveraging both Dapr and cloud resources.
