In this lab you will switch the local and cluster hosted resources for the Dapr building blocks to Azure resources. In particular, these are the Azure resources we are going to use:
- Azure Blob Storage (State building block)
- Azure Service Bus (Pub/Sub building block
- Azure Key vault (Secret store building block)
The first two resources use the existing Kubernetes secret store building block. As the last step you will change this to Azure Key vault.
